Python code to run a text-based simulation of the tasks carried out by a bank ATM, completed as part of school work aged 14. 
Significant pieces of code have been done in Python throughout my undergraduate degree (Mathematics BSc (Hons) at University of St. Andrews) but these cannot be reproduced here due to the university's policy on assessed work.
